# ML Team Survey Strategy: Quantifying the Pain Points

## The Data Gap We Need to Fill

### Current Assumptions (Need Validation):
- "70% of ML teams waste compute budgets on scaling decisions"
- "Most teams make resource decisions based on intuition"
- "Hyperparameter optimization is a universal pain point"
- "Teams lack systematic approaches to cost-performance trade-offs"

### What We Actually Need to Know:
1. **Current Practices**: How do teams actually make scaling decisions?
2. **Pain Points**: What are the biggest resource optimization challenges?
3. **Tools & Methods**: What frameworks are teams currently using?
4. **Budget Impact**: How much time/money is wasted on inefficient optimization?
5. **Decision Makers**: Who makes compute budget decisions?
6. **Interest Level**: Would teams pay for ROI-driven scaling frameworks?

## Survey Design Strategy

### **Option 1: Pre-Series Survey (Validates Assumptions)**
**Timing**: Before LinkedIn series launch
**Purpose**: Quantify pain points to strengthen content credibility
**Sample Size**: 50-100 ML practitioners
**Distribution**: LinkedIn polls, Twitter, ML communities

### **Option 2: Series-Integrated Survey (Builds Community)**
**Timing**: Embedded within LinkedIn series
**Purpose**: Engage audience while gathering data
**Sample Size**: 200-500 practitioners
**Distribution**: Each post drives survey participation

### **Option 3: Post-Series Validation Survey (Measures Impact)**
**Timing**: After series completion
**Purpose**: Validate framework adoption and refine for Phase 3
**Sample Size**: 100-200 practitioners
**Distribution**: Series followers and new audience

## Recommended Approach: Series-Integrated Survey

### **Why This Works Best:**
1. **Builds Community**: Survey participation creates investment in series
2. **Generates Content**: Survey results become additional LinkedIn posts
3. **Validates in Real-Time**: Can adjust messaging based on early responses
4. **Creates Urgency**: Limited-time survey creates FOMO
5. **Drives Engagement**: People love sharing their experiences
